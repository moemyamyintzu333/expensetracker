## Browser Storage

### How Data is Stored
- Uses browser's localStorage API
- Data is stored as JSON
- Storage key: 'expenseTracker'
- Typical storage: ~5-10MB available per domain

### Storage Format
```json
{
  "expenses": [
    {
      "id": "1732287600000",
      "description": "Coffee",
      "amount": 4.50,
      "timestamp": 1732287600000,
      "date": "2025-09-22"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Storage Limitations
- Data is domain-specific (only available on this page)
- Private/incognito browsing may limit or disable storage
- Storage quota varies by browser (typically 5-10MB)
- Data may be cleared by browser cleanup or user action

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: My expenses disappear when I refresh the page**
A: Check if localStorage is enabled in your browser settings. Some privacy modes or browser configurations disable localStorage.

**Q: I can't enter decimal amounts**
A: Use a period (.) as the decimal separator, not a comma. Enter amounts like "4.50" not "4,50".

**Q: The app shows a storage warning**
A: Your browser's localStorage is disabled or unavailable. Enable storage in browser settings or try a different browser.

**Q: I get "quota exceeded" errors**
A: Your browser's storage is full. Clear some browsing data or use your browser's developer tools to clear localStorage for this site.

### Browser-Specific Notes

**Safari**: In private browsing mode, localStorage has a very small quota (1MB or less)
**Firefox**: Strict privacy settings may block localStorage
**Chrome**: Incognito mode typically allows localStorage but it's temporary
**Edge**: InPrivate mode behavior similar to Chrome incognito

### Developer Tools

Access browser developer tools (F12) to:
- View console messages and errors
- Inspect localStorage data
- Test functionality with the built-in test suite

### Testing Commands
Open browser console and run:
```javascript
// Run all built-in tests
runAllTests();

// Check storage availability
isLocalStorageAvailable();

// View current data
console.log(expenseTracker.getAllExpenses());
console.log('Total:', expenseTracker.getTotalAmount());

// Manual test scenarios
ManualTestScenarios.listAllScenarios();
```

## Performance

- **Page load**: Instant (no external resources)
- **Add expense**: < 100ms response time
- **Storage operations**: < 1ms for typical usage
- **Memory usage**: Minimal (~1-2MB for 1000+ expenses)
- **Network**: Zero network requests after initial load

## Limitations

- **Single user**: No multi-user support or sharing
- **No categories**: Expenses are not categorized
- **No editing**: Cannot edit or delete expenses (by design for simplicity)
- **No reporting**: No charts, graphs, or advanced analytics
- **Browser dependent**: Data tied to specific browser/device
- **No backup**: No cloud backup or export functionality
