## User Guide

### Adding an Expense
1. Enter a description in the "Description" field (e.g., "Coffee", "Lunch", "Gas")
2. Enter the amount in the "Amount" field (e.g., 4.50, 12.00)
3. Click "Add Expense" button
4. The expense will appear in the list below
5. The total amount will update automatically

### Viewing Expenses

- Total amount is displayed prominently at the top

### Data Persistence

- Data persists when you close and reopen the browser
- Data is specific to this browser and computer
- No account or login required

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Scenario 1: First Time User

2. Verify page loads with empty expense list
3. Verify total shows $0.00
4. Verify form is ready for input

**Expected Result**: Clean interface ready for first expense

### Test Scenario 2: Add Single Expense

1. Enter "Coffee" in description field
2. Enter "4.50" in amount field
3. Click "Add Expense"
4. Verify expense appears in list
5. Verify total shows $4.50
6. Verify form is cleared

**Expected Result**: Expense added successfully, totals updated

### Test Scenario 3: Add Multiple Expenses

2. Add expense: "Lunch" - $12.00
3. Add expense: "Gas" - $35.00
4. Verify all three expenses in list
5. Verify total shows $51.50

**Expected Result**: All expenses tracked, correct total calculated

### Test Scenario 4: Data Persistence
**Steps**:
1. Add several expenses
2. Note the total amount
3. Refresh the browser page
4. Verify all expenses are still there
5. Verify total is unchanged

**Expected Result**: Data persists across browser sessions

### Test Scenario 5: Input Validation
**Steps**:
1. Try to submit with empty description → Should show error
2. Try to submit with negative amount → Should show error  
3. Try to submit with zero amount → Should show error
4. Try to submit with non-numeric amount → Should show error
5. Submit valid expense → Should work normally

**Expected Result**: Invalid inputs rejected with helpful error messages

### Test Scenario 6: Error Recovery
**Steps**:
1. Submit invalid expense (triggers error)
2. Correct the input
3. Submit again
4. Verify error message disappears
5. Verify expense is added normally

**Expected Result**: Application recovers gracefully from validation errors

## Browser Compatibility

### Supported Browsers
- Chrome 50+ (recommended)
- Firefox 45+
- Safari 10+
- Edge 14+

### Required Features
- localStorage support
- ES6 JavaScript support
- CSS Grid/Flexbox support

### Testing in Different Browsers
1. Test all scenarios in each supported browser
2. Verify consistent appearance and behavior
3. Verify localStorage works in all browsers
4. Test responsive design on mobile browsers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Expenses disappear when I refresh**
A: Check if localStorage is enabled in browser settings. Some privacy modes disable localStorage.

**Q: Can't enter decimal amounts**
A: Use period (.) as decimal separator, not comma (,). Enter amounts like 4.50, not 4,50.

**Q: Error messages won't go away**
A: Refresh the page if error state gets stuck. This resets the form validation.

**Q: Total seems wrong**
A: Check that all amounts were entered correctly. The total is calculated by adding all expense amounts.

### Technical Issues

**Q: Page won't load**
A: Ensure you're opening the HTML file in a web browser, not a text editor.

**Q: JavaScript errors in console**
A: Check browser console for specific error messages. Ensure browser supports required JavaScript features.
