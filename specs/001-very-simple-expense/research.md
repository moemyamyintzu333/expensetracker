# Research: Simple Expense Tracker

## Technology Decisions

### Decision: Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript
**Rationale**: 
- Aligns with constitutional principle of simplicity
- No build process or dependencies required
- Immediate execution in any modern browser
- Easy to understand and debug
- LocalStorage API is well-supported across browsers

**Alternatives considered**:
- React/Vue: Rejected due to unnecessary complexity for simple CRUD operations
- Node.js + Express: Rejected as no server needed with LocalStorage
- CSS frameworks: Rejected to keep dependencies minimal

### Decision: LocalStorage for persistence
**Rationale**:
- Built into all modern browsers
- Synchronous API perfect for simple operations
- Persists across browser sessions
- No server setup required
- Meets requirement for offline functionality

**Alternatives considered**:
- IndexedDB: Rejected as overkill for simple key-value storage
- Server-based storage: Rejected to maintain simplicity
- Cookies: Rejected due to size limitations

### Decision: Manual testing approach
**Rationale**:
- Simple application with limited UI interactions
- Easy to verify functionality in browser developer tools
- Aligns with testing simplicity principle
- No test framework setup required

**Alternatives considered**:
- Jest/Mocha: Rejected as unnecessary for this scope
- Cypress/Selenium: Rejected as overkill for simple functionality
- Test frameworks would add complexity without proportional benefit

## Best Practices Research

### LocalStorage Best Practices
- Always check for browser support before using
- Handle JSON stringify/parse errors gracefully
- Use try-catch blocks for localStorage operations
- Validate data structure when loading from storage
- Consider storage quota limits (typically 5-10MB)

### Vanilla JavaScript Best Practices
- Use ES6+ features (const/let, arrow functions, template literals)
- Implement clear separation of concerns
- Use event delegation for dynamic content
- Validate user input before processing
- Provide immediate visual feedback for user actions

### CSS Best Practices
- Use CSS Grid/Flexbox for layout
- Implement responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Ensure accessibility with proper contrast and focus states

## Implementation Patterns

### Data Structure Pattern
```javascript
// Expense object structure
{
  id: unique_identifier,
  description: string,
  amount: number,
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  date: formatted_date_string
}

// Storage structure
{
  expenses: [expense_objects],
  totalBalance: number (calculated, not stored)
}
```

### UI Update Pattern
- Single source of truth in localStorage
- Reload data after each operation
- Update both expense list and total display
- Clear form after successful addition
- Show validation errors inline

### Error Handling Pattern
- Try-catch blocks around localStorage operations
- Input validation before processing
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation if localStorage unavailable

## Conclusion
All technical decisions support the constitutional principles of simplicity and clear data flow. No external dependencies required, straightforward implementation path identified.
