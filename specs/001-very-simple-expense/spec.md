# Feature Specification: Simple Expense Tracker

**Feature Branch**: `001-very-simple-expense`  
**Created**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "very simple expense tracker only with this two function add a new expense and update total balance Don't add other functions"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Feature description provided: Simple expense tracker with two functions
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Actors: User; Actions: add expense, update balance; Data: expenses, balance; Constraints: only these two functions
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All core functionality clearly specified, scope explicitly bounded
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Clear user flows for both functions identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Requirements are testable and aligned with minimal scope
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Expense and Balance entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ No implementation details, focused on user value
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to track their expenses in the simplest way possible. They need to record new expenses as they occur and see their updated total balance after each expense. The system should be minimal and focused only on these core actions without any additional complexity.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has an initial balance, **When** they add a new expense with an amount, **Then** the expense is recorded and the total balance is automatically updated by subtracting the expense amount
2. **Given** a user has recorded several expenses, **When** they add another expense, **Then** the new expense is added to their expense list and the balance reflects all expenses
3. **Given** a user wants to see their current financial status, **When** they view their balance, **Then** they can see the total remaining balance after all recorded expenses

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to add an expense with zero or negative amount?
- How does the system handle very large expense amounts?
- What happens if a user tries to add an expense when the balance would go negative?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to add a new expense with an amount
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically update the total balance when a new expense is added
- **FR-003**: System MUST subtract the expense amount from the current balance
- **FR-004**: System MUST display the current total balance to the user
- **FR-005**: System MUST persist expense records so they are not lost
- **FR-006**: System MUST NOT include any other functionality beyond adding expenses and updating balance
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate that expense amounts are positive numbers
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle decimal amounts for expenses

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Expense**: Represents a single expense entry with an amount and timestamp
- **Balance**: Represents the current total balance, calculated by starting amount minus all recorded expenses
